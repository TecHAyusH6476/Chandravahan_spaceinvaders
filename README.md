How to avoid orbital debris collision
Firstly we will assume the frame of reference wrt space.
Taking into considering of relativistic efects we have to find the shortest path in which there is no obstacle.
equation used: F = G mEmO/d2.
unching a satellite into orbit requires consideration of a number of major science ideas. These include gravity, circular motion and atmospheric drag.
We have to calculate path everytime the satellite encounters the obstacle(asteroid, etc) wrt the realtive speed of meteor.
Finally calculating the realtive speed require to avoid the obstacle with it shortest path.
